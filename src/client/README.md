# Lokim's Front End Codebase

This client uses ReactJS and React Router as the main framework

### Things to note include: 
- Frontend must be proxied to server port via package.json to avoid CORS issues in development. This is because Create-React-App uses webpack which launches a local development server on port 3000
- Will add more as I remember
