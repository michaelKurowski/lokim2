## Texture and Overall Feeling
 - Offset shadows
 - Avoid borders, give sections different colors, or apply shadows
 - Keep extra spacing between sections
 - Use accent borders when there's not much colors
## Buttons
 - Use accent borders to make buttons highlighted
 - Not every button needs background color, keep rarerly used options as buttons with similiar color to background
 - Don't add borders for teriary buttons, an underline for text should be enough
 - Destructive actions should be red only if they're primary actions
## Font
 - Use weight and color to create hierarchy, instead of size
 - Don't use grey color on colour backgrounds, instead use white with reduced opacity,
 or hand pick a color of that text
## Alerts and Errors
 - Use accent borders to enforce distinction between types of messages
 - Use background color to distinct between types of messages
## Animations as Form of Drawing Attention
